## Getting Started

### Step 1 - Create from template

To create a new Panel extension:

```bash
pixi exec --spec copier --spec ruamel.yaml -- copier copy --trust https://github.com/panel-extensions/copier-template-panel-extension <panel-extension-name>
```

To update to a newer template version:

```bash
pixi exec --spec copier --spec ruamel.yaml -- copier update --defaults --trust
```

Note: `copier` will show `Conflict` for files with manual changes during an updateâ€”this is normal. As long as there are no merge conflict markers, all patches applied cleanly.

### Step 2 - Setup GitHub Pages docs

Enable GitHub Pages through Settings > Pages on the GitHub toolbar:

On your GitHub repo's sidebar's About section, be sure to add the link to your docs page and some tags!

If your docs page is missing a sidebar, remember to add imports to `src/__init__.py` and add them to `__all__`!

### Step 3 - Link to PyPi

Head over to https://pypi.org/manage/account/publishing and fill out the form:

#### Step 4 - Release with a tag

Now, when you've populated the template, you can release to PyPi by making a tag!
