## Features

{{ project_slug }}

## Pin your version!

This project is **in its early stages**, so if you find a version that suits your needs, it’s recommended to **pin your version**, as updates may introduce changes.

## Installation

Install it via `pip`:

```bash
pip install {{ project_slug }}
```

## Usage

```python
import {{ project_slug_snake_case }}
```

## Development

```bash
git clone {{ github_url }}
cd {{ project_slug }}
```

For a simple setup use [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate # on linux. Similar commands for windows and osx
uv pip install -e .[dev]
pre-commit run install
pytest tests
```

For the full Github Actions setup use [pixi](https://pixi.sh):

```bash
pixi run pre-commit-install
pixi run postinstall
pixi run test
```

This repository is based on [copier-template-panel-extension](https://github.com/panel-extensions/copier-template-panel-extension).
To update to the latest template version run:

```bash
pixi exec --spec copier --spec ruamel.yaml -- copier update --defaults --trust
```

Note: `copier` will show `Conflict` for files with manual changes during an update. This is normal. As long as there are no merge conflict markers, all patches applied cleanly.
